## Problem

In today's rapidly evolving financial landscape, there's a growing awareness of the critical importance of managing personal finances. This awareness stems from various factors such as economic uncertainties, shifting job markets, and an emphasis on financial literacy. As individuals navigate these complexities, they understand the significance of saving and investing their funds wisely.

Moreover, the rise of freelance work, entrepreneurship, and the gig economy has made it imperative for individuals to have a robust system in place for managing their income and expenses. This includes not only budgeting and saving but also effectively creating and managing invoices for different purposes such as freelance projects, small business ventures, or even personal services rendered.

Efficiently managing invoices is essential for several reasons. It ensures timely payments, helps track income streams, and provides clarity on financial transactions. Whether it's issuing invoices to clients, tracking payments received, or reconciling accounts, having a streamlined invoicing process is indispensable for maintaining financial stability and growth.

Furthermore, blockchain technology such as Minipay can played a pivotal role in revolutionizing how individuals manage their finances and invoices. With the advent of online banking, mobile payment apps such as Xpensa, people now have access to powerful tools that simplify financial tasks and empower them to take control of their financial lives.

In summary, the increasing awareness of personal finance management underscores the need for individuals to not only save their funds seamlessly but also to leverage efficient invoicing practices. By doing so, they can navigate the complexities of today's financial landscape with confidence and achieve their long-term financial goals.

## Solution

Xpensa is an all in one package that enables users to create and manage budgets for different purposes. This also helps them in 
tracking their day to day expenses. In addition to this Xpensa helps users to create invoices which can be shared in the form of a payment link which the client the invoice was intended for can easily use to make payments.

## Methodology

This project was built using Next.js app router which communicates with a smart contract backed deployed on the Celo network. 
A Trpc server with prisma orm and a postgres database is used to store more information off chain in order to reduce gas fees. The primary use case of the smart contract is to process payment.


## Challenges faced

The project started with a Next.js and a golang (fiber) backend server but due to time constraint the backend server was dropped for 
an easier to setup trpc server with prisma orm and a postgres database.
